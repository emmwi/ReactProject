# React + Vite

School-project SPA-application with vite and react. 
I've used 
. useContext
. Formik
. styled-components
. json-file as "backend" to fetch the users I have and also to fetch pictures of cars for the memory-game. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
